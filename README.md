# My-keeper-app project
# This app is built to keep notes for daily plan such as studying, working, relaxing, sleeping, meeting, etc.
# This project was created using mainly React, JavaScript along with NodeJS, and Visual Studio.
# This app works as a note to remind users with their daily plan. So far, I have not used backend on this project so that it cannot be store if users close the app.
# In the near fuutre, I will continue working on including backend development in this project in order for My-keeper-app to successfully store all users' notes.
